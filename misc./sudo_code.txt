Code to check amount of paths filled.


How the code works:

Create draggable div with header named "District Counter" classify with correct classes; create a dynamic list
where you can add elements through a "+" button.
When the plus is clicked new element appears with a new colourpicker and hex input and a name input for each;
Dynamic variable for: {
  hex value
  colour value
}
A dynamic variable is created for every colour selected through a loop (focus on [i]).
The variable for each path is paired with the value of the colour it is filled in (colour value).
A loop function checks which variables are filled with which colour and counts it.
The number for the amount of districts filled in with a colour is inserted into the inner html next to the dynamic list.

1. find out how to create a dynamic list ON the draggable div
2. find out how to make the colourpicker appear on every element and how to create the dynamic variables for each to works
3. create dynamic variables for each path
4. find out how to pair the path variable and the colour it is filled in with 
5. create the loop counter which checks which paths are filled with what colour
(doesnt check the XML paths but the javascript variables)
6. Insert this value into the html
