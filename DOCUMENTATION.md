## Map Types <a name="map"></a>
This project makes use of two distinct map filetypes. Although they both end up as inline SVGs once the initial loading sequence is complete, they start off as two wildly different filetypes.

### SVG (Vectors)
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphic, it is the standard digital filetype used for vector graphics. What is a vector graphic, you may ask? A vector graphic is a type of image file which, unlike .jpegs or .pngs, is not made out of individual coloured pixels to generate a given image, but rather a set of coordinates and commands which tell the computer between which points to draw lines. This means when zooming into a vector graphic the image quality never degrades, hence "scalable", since all drawing is done relitave to certain points on the plane on not absolutely.

### GeoJSON / topojson (Geographical Coordinates)
